# DaddyRobot-MixPlay-Chat-Shooter

This is one of the MixPlay experiences from https://daddyrobot.live/mixplays

You can find the Main Page's code here: https://github.com/tiedyedguy/DaddyRobot-MixPlay-MainPage


### How to copy this

1. Open up the Mixer's CDK program and make a new CDK.  
2. Set it to "Custom HTML". 
3. Copy all the code from the /src directory here over the /src directory there


### Control to update.

You will need to set the Control Scheme in the CDK to this and upload it:

{
  scenes: [
    {
      containers: [],
      controls: [
        {
          controlID: "points",
          kind: "button"
        }
      ],
      sceneID: "default"
    }
  ]
}
